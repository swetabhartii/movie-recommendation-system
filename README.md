In my data analytics project, I developed a movie recommendation system using Python. Leveraging libraries such as numpy, pandas, difflib, and sklearn, I created an efficient and user-friendly tool. The project primarily uses TfidfVectorizer from sklearn to transform movie plots into a matrix of TF-IDF features, capturing the importance of words in the context of movie descriptions. By applying cosine_similarity from sklearn's metrics.pairwise, the system computes the similarity between different movies based on these features. Additionally, difflib aids in finding close matches for user-inputted movie titles, ensuring accurate and relevant recommendations. The recommendation engine takes a user's favorite movie as input and suggests similar movies based on plot similarities. This project demonstrates the practical application of data science techniques in building intelligent systems that enhance user experience by providing personalized movie suggestions.
